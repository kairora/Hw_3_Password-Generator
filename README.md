# Password Generator

## Purpose

This app utilizes Javascript facilitate a browser-run application that generates a random password based on user inputs. These user inputs can be demonstrated as below:

## Functionality

1. Prompt a user-input number that will act as the length of the password. They will also be prompted if the number input is not between 8 and 128 and the function would restart.

2. Then prompt the user to answer whether they want lowercase characters.

3. Then prompt the user to answer whether they want uppercase characters.

4. Next, users are prompted for whether they prefer numbers in their passwords.

5. Finally, the user is prompted for whether they prefer to have special characters in their password.

The program would then check that the user has selected atleast one of the criteria and run conditions that would result in a password generated based on the inputs the user has made. 

## Future Enhancements:

I plan to add in the following features: 
1. Add more CSS to improve the overall UI aesthetic
2. Replace the alerts with more user-friendly and intuitive UI such as a modal, or form with checkboxes
3. Increase text size
